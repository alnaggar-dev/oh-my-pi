# A commit-by-commit fork never replays your patches, so nothing naturally tells you
# a customization has gone stale. This surfaces five things and decides nothing:
#   0. fork delta: how many existing upstream files you edit -> conflict surface
#   1. registry anchors (Touches/Symbols paths) that no longer exist -> orphaned
#   2. files your fork's own commits changed that no entry registers  -> unregistered
#   3. each entry's Status: + a DROP CANDIDATES list             -> retirement view
#   4. upstream commits since .fork/UPSTREAM you have NOT ported    -> your backlog
# Scope: the base is the .fork/UPSTREAM pointer (the last ported upstream commit),
# falling back to merge-base(HEAD, upstream) on a fork that hasn't ported yet. 0
# looks at edits since that base; 2 looks at your own (non-port) commits in
# base..HEAD; 4 looks at upstream commits after the pointer.
