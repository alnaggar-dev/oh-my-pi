#   ./.fork/port.sh revert [<sha>]                       un-port the NEWEST port (rewinds the pointer, gated)
#   ./.fork/port.sh continue                             finalize a paused port/unport after resolving conflicts

#
# This is the one place the porting INVARIANTS are enforced as code, not skill prose:
#   - every port is a `git cherry-pick -x --no-commit` (a MERGE adds `-m 1`, replaying the
#     merge's first-parent diff — its whole net effect — as one commit); a clean port stays
#     a real commit the integration gate can see — a bare cherry-pick runs NO hook;
#   - the pointer advances in the SAME commit, recorded as `<sha> <ref>` in .fork/UPSTREAM;
#   - the commit carries a strict `Fork-Flow-Port: <full-sha>` trailer (the SOLE signal
#     audit/propose-upstream use to tell a port from your own work — a stray pointer in
#     an ordinary commit is NOT a port);
#   - the pointer only ever moves FORWARD (the new sha must have the old pointer as an
#     ancestor on the upstream line), so it can't silently rewind;
#   - ports are CONTIGUOUS: only the OLDEST unported commit may be ported (`one <sha>`
#     refuses a later one), so the pointer can't jump PAST unported ancestors and bury
#     them from the backlog/audit;
#   - upstream MERGE commits are ported as a UNIT via `cherry-pick -m 1` — their
#     first-parent diff carries all merged (farm) content AND any evil-merge resolution
#     that lives in no single commit, and the merge SHA stays on the first-parent line;
#   - on conflict it STOPS and points you at conflict-context.sh, then `continue`.
# The actual gate (verify.sh --registry) still runs in the pre-commit hook on the final
# commit; this driver just makes the mechanics correct and hard to get wrong.
